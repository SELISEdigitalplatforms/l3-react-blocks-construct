<primary />

## Properties

<Controls />

## Variants

- **Default:** Displays a list of links separated by a separator.

## Best Practices

- Use breadcrumbs for apps with multiple navigation levels.
- Keep labels short and meaningful.
- The last item in the breadcrumb should represent the current page and not be a link.
