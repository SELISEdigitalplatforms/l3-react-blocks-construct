The Accordion component allows users to toggle the visibility of content sections. It is commonly used to group related information and reduce visual clutter.

## Variants

- **Default** — Standard accordion with collapsible content.
- **Multiple** — Allows more than one section to be open at the same time.
- **Single** — Restricts to only one section being open at a time.

## Props

- type: Defines the behavior of the accordion. Can be single or multiple.
- collapsible: (boolean) If true, allows closing all items, leaving none open.
- disabled: (boolean) Disables interaction with the accordion item.

## Best Practices

- Use Accordions to organize related but optional content.
- Keep section titles clear and concise.
- Avoid nesting accordions inside other accordions.
- Ensure keyboard navigation works as expected for accessibility.
