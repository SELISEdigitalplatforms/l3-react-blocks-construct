### States & Behavior

Badges can represent different states or visual styles:

- **Default** — standard badge for general use.
- **Secondary** — for less prominent labels.
- **Destructive** — indicates errors or warnings.
- **Outline** — a minimal style variant.

#### Default

<Canvas of={BadgeStories.Default} />

#### Secondary

<Canvas of={BadgeStories.Secondary} />

#### Destructive

<Canvas of={BadgeStories.Destructive} />

#### Outline

<Canvas of={BadgeStories.Outline} />

## Accessibility

- Use concise text inside the badge so it’s clear to screen readers.
- Ensure badge color contrast meets **WCAG AA** standards.
- Do not rely on color alone to convey meaning — pair with text when status matters.

## When to Use

- To label items with statuses like _Active_, _Pending_, or _Error_.
- To indicate categories or tags.
- To highlight numeric counts in compact UI elements.

Avoid using badges for long text strings or as standalone navigation elements.

## Best Practices

✅ **Do**

- Keep badge text short (1–2 words).
- Use consistent color meanings across your app.
- Pair with icons when clarity is needed.

❌ **Don’t**

- Overuse badges — too many can dilute their impact.
- Use them for critical alerts; rely on **Toasts** or **Modals** instead.
