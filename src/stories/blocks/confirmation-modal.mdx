## Accessibility

- Ensure the modal is **focus-trapped** to prevent background interaction.
- Use `aria-labelledby` to associate the modal with its title.
- Use `aria-describedby` to associate the modal with its message.
- Provide clear and descriptive labels for the **Confirm** and **Cancel** buttons.
- Ensure the modal is **keyboard navigable**, supporting Tab, Enter, and Escape keys.

## When to Use

- When performing **irreversible actions** like deleting items or data.
- Before executing actions that **cannot be undone**.
- To confirm user intent for **critical operations**.

## Best Practices

✅ **Do**

- Provide a clear and concise message explaining the action.
- Use contrasting colors to distinguish the confirm and cancel buttons.
- Ensure the modal is responsive and accessible on all devices.

❌ **Don’t**

- Overuse confirmation modals — reserve them for critical actions.
- Use ambiguous language in the modal’s message.
- Block the entire interface with the modal; allow users to dismiss it easily.
